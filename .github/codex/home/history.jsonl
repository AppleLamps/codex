Keep the existing layout (header, nav, content, footer) but refine it for real-world standards. Requirements:\n\nResponsive design: Mobile-first CSS with a collapsible nav menu (hamburger on small screens) and fluid grid-based layouts.\n\nAccessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  semantic HTML5, ARIA roles, skip-to-content link, proper landmarks, color contrast, focus states, and full keyboard navigation.\n\nPerformance: Minified CSS/JS, lazy-loaded scripts, optimized styles, lightweight animations. No frameworks.\n\nSEO readiness: Unique meta titles/descriptions, proper heading structure, canonical links, sitemap placeholder, open graph tags.\n\nDark mode: Toggle button that persists with localStorage.\n\nComponents: Reusable cards, buttons, hero sections, and a styled news article template.\n\nForms: Contact form with client-side validation (accessible error messages).\n\nContent structure: Build at least 4 pages  index.html (home), about.html, news.html (with article placeholders), and contact.html. Ensure consistent header/footer across pages.\n\nPolish: Smooth hover states, clear typography hierarchy, whitespace balance, consistent branding colors.\n\nDeployment ready: All links must be relative and work offline on any static host. Provide a short README.html summarizing features, structure, and how to deploy."}
